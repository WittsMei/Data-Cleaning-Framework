## Data Analyics Lifecycle

One key principle to keep in mind is that for any new analytic skill you're learning, it's always important to really understand the business context in which it's being applied.

## Step 1: Conceptualize the dataset

- **Identify grain, measure, and dimensions**

- **Identify critical vs. non-critical**

- **Understand column definitions**

It is recommended that you spend 30 mins to an hour understanding the dataset. By the end of the step, you should be able to say something like:

This dataset represents sales data, where every single record represents a transaction. The most important columns are the sales columns and the data columns. And there's also supplementary information about the product, customer demographics and marketing information. The data spans from 2019 to 2024.



## Step 2: Locate solvable issues

- **Formatting**: currency, date, and number formats

- **Consistency**: spelling, spacing differences, categorization consistency

- **Duplicates**: erroneously repeated


How to find those isseus?

When it is acturally good enough?

The most important thing is not to find every signle issue and end up with a perfect dataset. You just need to prioritize the columns that you identify as critical columns at first to make them useable, and then move forward with the analysis and start diving into the insights. Make sure you always have a raw version dataset so that you can always circle back to this process and clean the data even more if you need to.



## Step 3: Evaluate unsolvable challenges
